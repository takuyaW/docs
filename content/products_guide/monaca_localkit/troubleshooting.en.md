## Removing Monaca Localkit (for Windows)

While uninstalling Monaca Localkit, you might not be able to remove its
remaining files. In this case, please remove them manually from Program
Files folder.

## Incomplete Files and Folder Structure

Monaca/Cordova projects initially consist of the following files and
folders

| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `www/` |	Storage folder for the main body of the application |
| `config.xml` |	Cordova configuration file |


In this section, we will talk about how to fix your project if `www/` or
`config.xml` file is missing.

### Missing www Folder

#### For Standard Projects

The user should create `www` folder in the project root or restore a
previous backup of the folder.

#### For Webpack Projects

`www` folder will be created automatically during transpiling process.
Transpiling is triggered automatically after selecting on the project
from project list within Monaca Localkit, if the option has been
enabled.

### Missing config.xml File

{{<note>}}
    This solution will only work if your project is existed on Monaca Cloud.
{{</note>}}

1.  From Localkit, select the project from the project list.
2.  Click {{<guilabel name="Download">}}. Then, `config.xml` file will be restored.
