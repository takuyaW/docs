## What is Monaca?

Monaca is a development environment for smartphone and tablet applications provided by Asial Corporation. Monaca does not only provide you with a development environment at your fingertips but also allows anyone to be able to develop smartphone applications easier.

Monaca uses a hybrid approach to deliver mobile apps. It makes [hybrid mobile app](#feature_hybrid_app) development process with PhoneGap/Cordova simpler and stress-free with our comprehensive cloud-powered app development tools and services. Monaca is framework-agnostic and adaptive, ready to be immediately plugged into your existing workflow and development environment, creating the most open Cordova platform available.

## Why use Monaca?

Monaca's top 3 benefits are:

-   Cloud-Empowered Development: Our tools are designed to utilize the
    cloud to supercharge your app development in two ways. The complete
    cloud development environment gives you flexibility with no setup
    required. And the cloud-synced local development enables you to use
    your own environment but enjoy features like device live-sync and
    remote build. It’s the best of both worlds.
-   Mix-and-Match as You Like: We’ve got you covered all the way from
    design, app development, backend development, testing & debugging to
    build & distribution. Monaca can be used as a whole or a piece,
    working with your favorite tools like Sublime Text or Git. Just pick
    what you need. We will seamlessly plug into your workflow.
-   Framework Agnostic: Our open source Angular-driven [Onsen
    Framework](http://onsen.io/) is tightly integrated with Monaca
    tools. However, you can use whatever framework you want. Ionic or
    PhoneGap developers, for example, can seamlessly use our [Monaca CLI](../monaca_cli/) to take advantages of the
    cloud-powered services without switching or any complicated porting.
    We take OPEN seriously.

## Monaca Development Tools

For your flexibility and convenience during app development process,
Monaca provides four different development environments as shown in the
following subsections.

### Monaca Cloud IDE

Monaca Cloud IDE provides a browser-based development environment as a
service. Right from your Web browser, all of your Cordova development is
done without any setup. Along with the [Monaca Debugger](../debugger), Live
Preview (built-in function in Monaca Cloud IDE) allows you to easily
check the progress of your apps during development. Noticeably, there
are neither Cordova plugins nor native functions in Live Preview.
Therefore, the app required those plugins and functions can't be
previewed properly. [Read more](../monaca_ide/).

### Monaca Localkit

Monaca Localkit is a local environment development support tool offered
through our app development platform, “Monaca”. You can achieve better
security and peace-of-mind from your own app development environment by
combining existing tools such as code editors and version management
system, with the versatile development support capabilities of Monaca.
With Monaca Localkit, Monaca users are able to setup their preferred
development environment on local PC. [Read more](../monaca_localkit/).

### Monaca CLI

Monaca CLI provides command line interface to use Monaca Cloud. It
features the debugger connection, inspector integration, project
creation and remote building. You can also import projects that exist in
the cloud when you want to switch your environment to local. [Read more](../monaca_cli/).


### Monaca for Visual Studio

Monaca for Visual Studio is another local development tool provided by
Monaca. With this tool, Monaca users are able to develop an app using
Visual Studio as the development environment. It’s free if you are a
Visual Studio Community user. [Read more](../monaca_vs/).

## Monaca Debugger

On top of the flexibility in the development environment, Monaca also
provides high development efficiency by using Monaca Debugger. Monaca
Debugger is an application used to test and debug your Monaca
applications on real devices without building the applications during
the development. It needs to be installed on your mobile devices. The
app will automatically sync all your development projects and run them
without the build process. [Read more](../debugger/).

Here is a table summarizing the debugging options between Monaca
Debugger and Monaca development tools. For more information, please

<a name="feature_hybrid_app"><b>Characteristics of hybrid apps</b></a>

-   The apps consist of the Web and native characteristics. (See the
    picture below)
-   Regardless of operating systems, it will run on a browser component
    (cross-platform support). In other words, hybrid apps can run on
    iOS, Android, and other supported platforms, since it runs on
    WebView component of those platforms. Therefore, one source code can
    run on multiple supported platforms.

{{< figure src="/images/monaca_intro/4.png" title="Differences between Native, Hybrid, and Web Apps">}}


Required knowledge for hybrid app development:

* HTML and CSS for UI (User Interface) design
* JavaScript for implementing the app
* JavaScript libraries for accessing the native functions of a device and additional plugins

{{< note >}}
    iOS/Android apps run on Cordova and use <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>, a JavaScript library, to access native functions of a device. Windows apps run on Windows runtime while Chrome apps run on Chrome runtime.
