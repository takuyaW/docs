There is a growing need for mobile apps to have user management
functions which allow users to register and keep their data in a
database. Monaca Backend provides these functionality in advance as a
cloud-based service that can manage users without a need for server-side
development on the client part.

-   Monaca Backend sample app is described in [Backend Memo](/en/sampleapp/samples/backend_memo).
-   Monaca Backend API is listed in [Backend API](/en/reference/monaca_api/cloud).

{{<note>}}
