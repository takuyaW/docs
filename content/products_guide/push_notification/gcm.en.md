Monaca sends push notifications via FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging). FCM
is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably deliver
messages at no cost. Using FCM, you can notify a client app that new
email or other data is available to sync. You can send notification
messages to drive user reengagement and retention. For use cases such as
instant messaging, a message can transfer a payload of up to `4KB` to a
client app.

In this page, we will guide you to enable push notifications service for
Android applications with Monaca.

## Step 1: Get API Key from Firebase Console

`Server API key` and `Sender ID` from Firebase console is required to
integrate FCM with Monaca. To get this API key, please proceed as
follows:

1.  Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and sign in with a valid Google account.
2.  Click on {{<guilabel name="+ Add project">}}.

    menu.

5.  In the Settings page, go to `CLOUD MESSAGING`. Then, you will be able
    to see the `Server Key` and `Sender ID` which will be used in Monaca
    push notification settings later. The `Server Key` is Server API key
    for the push notification and the `Sender ID` represents a sender.
