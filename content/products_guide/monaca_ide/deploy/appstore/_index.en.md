Before publishing iOS apps to the App Store, your apps need to be
reviewed and accepted by Apple. iTunes Connect is where you can upload
your apps, edit their descriptions and metadata, and view finances
earned. Once, your apps are submitted, you will need to wait for the
review from Apple. Apple will check if your apps are eligible or
qualified to be in the App Store. Usually, it takes two weeks for the
review. Therefore, please wait patiently for it.
