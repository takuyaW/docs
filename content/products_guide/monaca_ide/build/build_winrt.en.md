## Windows Store Apps

Windows Store apps are created by using HTML5 and JavaScript , and they
run natively on the WinRT architecture. Therefore, applications created
by using Monaca are equipped with the same functionalities as created by
development tools such as Visual Studio, and can use all native features
including WinJS.

Windows Store apps run on PCs and tablets installed with Windows and
Windows RT. However, if you want to publish the app to the Windows
Store, you will need to rebuild it separately by using Visual Studio or
other development tools since the release build from Monaca are not
supported yet.

On the other hand, Windows Store apps have various constraints that are
not found on Android or iOS such as:

-   There are some methods or features that are not supported since
    HTML5 or JavaScript runs in Trident/Chakra application mode. For
    more details, please refer to [HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Features and
    Difference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465380.aspx).

## Prerequisite

You are required to have a valid Microsoft Developer License in order to
build Windows apps. It's free but you need to have a Microsoft account.
If you don't have the license, please register
[here](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/programs/join).

##  Step 1: Configure Windows App Settings

1.  From the Monaca Cloud IDE menu, go to `Config` &rarr; `Windows App Settings`.
2.  Fill in the necessary information of your app:

    <table class="small">
        <tr>
            <td width="25%">Package Certificate Key</td>
            <td>This certificate is used when Monaca compiles to Windows app. It will also be used when doing side-loading or submitting to Windows Store. It will be generated automatically in the first Windows build if it does not exist. If you want to upload existing certificate file, it should be a <code>PKCS#7</code> format without password.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>App Display Name</td>
            <td>Enter the application name. It will appear on the Start screen.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Package Display Name</td>
            <td>Enter the package name.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Show Name</td>
            <td>Define default setting of logo displayed in start menu of windows 8 or higher.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Version</td>
            <td>Enter the version number of your app. A version number consist of only number seperated by dots (for example, 0.0.1.0).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>App Description</td>
            <td>A short summary about your app.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Package Publisher Name</td>
            <td>It could be your name, group name, company name, etc.</td>
