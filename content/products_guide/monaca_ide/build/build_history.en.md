Everytime you build your app through Monaca IDE, Monaca saves your build
history where you can see your build detail and error logs.

## View build history

You can view your build history as following:

1.  From the Monaca Cloud IDE menu, go to `Build` &rarr; `Build History`.
2.  Your built history will be displayed as following.

    {{<img src="/images/monaca_ide/manual/build/history/1.png" width="600">}}

3.  Click on {{<guilabel name="Remove">}} button to remove particular item from your history
    or {{<guilabel name="Download">}} button to download the built app. Once an item is removed, it cannot be undone.
