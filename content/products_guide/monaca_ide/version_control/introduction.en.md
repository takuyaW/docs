Version control is a management tool that helps manage the changes to
your project's source code and other collections of information.
Usually, changes are determined by a revision code which is comprised of
numbers and/or letters. With version control, revision history can
easily be tracked, compared against, restored and merged to control the
whole set of your source code. Additionally, version control systems
provide is the ability to allow multiple team members or individuals to
collaborate and maintain tracking over the source code.

Version Control is available within Monaca Cloud IDE with user-friendly
interface. There are many version control systems. Currently Monaca
Cloud IDE supports the integration of [GitHub](https://github.com) and
any Git services using SSH. If you integrate your Monaca project to your
