JS/CSS components are JavaScript and CSS libraries you may need to
include to your project such as jQuery, jQuery mobile, Onsen UI and so
on.

In order to add a JavaScript/CSS library, please do as follows:

1.  From Monaca Cloud IDE, go to {{<menu menu1="Config" menu2="Manage JS/CSS Components">}}.
2.  Then, `Add or Remove JS/CSS Components` page will be shown. You can see several libraries listed there. If you can't find the library you want, input the library's name in a search box to find it.

3.  Assuming you are searching for Angular, a list of matched libraries will be shown. Click {{<guilabel name="Add">}} to include the library to your project.

4.  Then, you can choose which version of the library to include in your project.

5.  Next, select which files of the library you want to include and click {{<guilabel name="OK">}}.

6.  After that, you will find your newly added library in the list. Click on {{<guilabel name="Configure">}} button when you want to change the library's version and selected files.

When a library is added, its files are added into `www/components`
folder. The following JavaScript and CSS files will also be
automatically updated. These files will always be presented regardless
of which libraries are added into your project.

| File Name | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `components/loader.js` | 	A JavaScript file to load for all active libraries |
| `components/loader.css` | 	A Style sheet file for all active libraries |

Therefore, libraries can be loaded by simply referencing the two files
(as shown above) in the HMTL file. More specifically, all you need to do
is include the following descriptors within the `<head>` tag of the HTML
file.

{{<highlight html>}}
<script src="components/loader.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="components/loader.css">
{{</highlight>}}


{{<note>}}
If you would like to use images within your libraries, you can directly load those image files from the <code>components</code> folder.
