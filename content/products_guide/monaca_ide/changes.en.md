Recently, we are just rolling out the new Monaca Cloud IDE. Even though
it is not the default IDE yet, you can switch between the new and old
IDE. The main changes in the new IDE are as follows:

1.  Some menu items are changed such as:

    -   Monaca Backend tab from the File Tree panel has been moved to header menu and labeled as `Backend`.
    -   `Editor Configuration` menu item has been moved under `File` menu.
    -   `Build` menu item has been renamed to `App`.
    -   Application and Build settings from the `Config` menu item has been moved to the new `App` menu item.
    -   `Support & Service Overview` is removed from `Help & Support` menu item.

2.  Ace Editor, which is used in the old IDE, is replaced by the
    CodeMirror Editor. With this replacement, the following shortcut
    keys are changed. For a complete list of the shortcut keys for both
    old and new IDE, please refer to [Editor Shortcuts](../code_editor/editor/).
