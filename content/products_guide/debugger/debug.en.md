##  Monaca Debugger with Monaca Cloud IDE

There are 2 main debugging mechanism can be used to debug Monaca apps
with Monaca Cloud IDE such as:

-   [Monaca Debug Panel](#debugger-debug-panel): DOM inspection and console debugging.
-   [USB Debugging](#debugger-usb-debug): DOM inspection, console and JavaScript debugging.

### Monaca Debug Panel

A popular Web debugging tool, [Weinre (WEb INspector REmote)](https://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/), is
embedded in debug panel of Monaca Cloud IDE. This tool allows you to
debug your app using console debugging and DOM inspection.

{{<figure src="/images/debugger/manual/debug/1.png" title="Debug Panel inside Monaca Cloud IDE">}}

In order to start debugging your app by using Monaca Debugger with
Monaca Cloud IDE, please follow the following instruction:

1.  Open a project in Monaca Cloud IDE.
2.  Run the project in Monaca Debugger.
3.  Make sure your device is connected with the IDE. For example, if
    your device appears in the debug panel, it is successfully connected
    to the IDE (see the screenshot below). Otherwise, please refresh the
    IDE or debugger until the connection is successfully made. After
    your device is connected to the IDE, you can start debugging your
    app.

    {{<figure src="/images/debugger/manual/debug/2.png">}}

#### Console Debugging

Console API allows you to write/display message to the Console using
Javascript.

Here are some common used Console APIs:

-   `console.log()`: displays a message to the console.
-   `console.debug()`: displays a message as debug level (you can see
    the message in the debug tab).
-   `console.warn()`: displays a message with yellow warning icon.

{{<note>}}
    For more information about Console APIs, please refer to {{<link href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console-api" title="Console API references">}}.
{{</note>}}

Here is an example of using Console APIs:

1.  Copy and paste the following code into the `index.html` file.

    {{<highlight html>}}
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no">
        <script src="components/loader.js"></script>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="components/loader.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
        <script>
            var a = 1;
            var b = 2;

            function debug(){
                var c = a + b;
                console.log("debug() function is executed!");
                console.log("executed! variable c is " + c);
            }

            debug();
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
    {{</highlight>}}

2.  Save the code and connect Monaca Debugger with Monaca Cloud IDE. Run
    the project in Monaca Cloud IDE. Now you can see those messages in
    the debug panel in Monaca Cloud IDE and in the app log inside the
    Monaca Debugger.

    {{<figure src="/images/debugger/manual/debug/3.png" title="Debug Panel in Monaca Cloud IDE">}}
    {{<figure src="/images/debugger/manual/debug/6.png" title="App Log in Monaca Debugger" width="300">}}

3.  This debug panel also allows you to see the error log of your app as
    well.

    {{<figure src="/images/debugger/manual/debug/4.png">}}

#### DOM Inspection

DOM (Document Object Model) Inspection allows you to:

-   view DOM structure of the currently active page.
-   modify the DOM structure as well as CSS of the page with live
    update.

For more information, please refer to [DOM Inspection and Style Editing](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/dom-and-styles).

{{<figure src="/images/debugger/manual/debug/5.png" title="DOM Inspection inside Debug Panel">}}

### USB Debugging

With USB debugging, you can:

-   Console debugging: uses console to diplay messages and set debugging
    sessions.
-   DOM inspection: views and modifies DOM structures with live updates.
-   JavaScript debugging: profiles JavaScript performance, sets
    breakpoint and execution control.

There are two ways to implement USB debugging depends on what kind of
device you use:

1.  If you are using iOS device, you can use [Safari Remote Debugging](#usb-debugging-ios).
2.  If you are using Android device, you can use [Chrome Remote Debugging](#usb-debugging-android).

#### Safari Remote Debugging (for iOS and Mac only)

{{<note>}}
    You are required to do some setups before using USB debugging with Monaca. Please refer to {{<link href="#pre-debug-app" title="Prerequisite for USB Debugging with Monaca">}}.
{{</note>}}

1.  Connect your iOS device to your Mac via a USB cable.
2.  Run your Monaca project in your Monaca custom built debugger.
3.  Open Safari app and go to `Develop` menu. Your iOS device's name
    should be shown in the list. Then, you can select each available
    page of Monaca app from a submenu belonged to your device's name.

    {{<figure src="/images/debugger/manual/debug/9.png">}}

4.  Then, the Web Inspector window will appear. In this window, you can
    use timing HTTP requests, profiling JavaScript, manipulating the DOM
    tree, and more. In order to learn how to use Web Inspector, please
    refer to [Safari Web Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007874).

    {{<figure src="/images/debugger/manual/debug/10.png">}}

#### Chrome Remote Debugging (for Android with Google Chrome Browser)

{{<note>}}
    You are required to do some setups before using USB debugging with Monaca. Please refer to {{<link href="#pre-debug-app" title="Prerequisite for USB Debugging with Monaca">}}.
{{</note>}}

1.  Connect your Android device to your PC via a USB cable.
2.  Run your Monaca project in Monaca Debugger.
3.  In Chrome address bar, enter `chrome://inspect/`.
4.  Then, the Devices page appears as shown below. Your connected
    Android device should be shown there. Click {{<guilabel name="inspect">}} belonged to your
    device.

    {{<figure src="/images/debugger/manual/debug/7.png">}}

5.  Then, the Chrome Inspection page should be appeared. Now you can
    start debugging your Monaca app. For more information, please refer
    to [How to Use Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools).

    {{<figure src="/images/debugger/manual/debug/8.png">}}

##  Monaca Debugger with Monaca Local Development Tools

Monaca local development tools are Monaca CLI, Monaca Localkit and
Monaca for Visual Studio.
