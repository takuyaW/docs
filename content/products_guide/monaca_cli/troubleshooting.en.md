## Incomplete Files and Folder Structure

Monaca/Cordova projects initially consist of the following files and folders:

| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `www/` |	Storage folder for the main body of the application |
| `config.xml` |	Cordova configuration file |

In this section, we will talk about how to fix your project if `www/` or `config.xml` file is missing.

### Missing www Folder

#### For Standard Projects

The user should create `www` folder in the project root or restore a
previous backup of the folder.

#### For Webpack Projects

The user should proceed as follows:

1.  In the command window, navigate to the project folder.
2.  Then, run `monaca transpile` command. This will generate the `www`
    folder with body of the application.

### Missing config.xml File

{{<note>}}
    This solution will only work if your project is existed on Monaca Cloud or you have the backup version of it.
{{</note>}}

1.  The user should create an empty `config.xml` file in the project
    root.
2.  Copy the content of the `config.xml` file of the project on the
    Cloud or the backup project.
3.  Paste the content to the empty `config.xml` file.
