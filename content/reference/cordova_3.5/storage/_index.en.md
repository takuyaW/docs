An overview of storage options for Cordova.

Several storage APIs are available for Cordova applications. See
[html5rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/storage). for a more
complete overview and examples.

LocalStorage
------------

Also known as *web storage*, *simple storage*, or by its alternate
*session storage* interface, this API provides synchronous key/value
pair storage, and is available in underlying WebView implementations.
Refer to [the W3C spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/) for details.

**Windows Phone 7 Quirk**: Dot notation is *not* available, so be sure
to use `setItem` or `getItem` rather than access keys directly from the
storage object, as in `window.localStorage.someKey`.

WebSQL
------

This API is available in the underlying WebView. The [Web SQL Database
Specification](http://dev.w3.org/html5/webdatabase/) offers more
full-featured database tables accessed via SQL queries.

The following platforms support WebSQL:

-   Android
-   iOS

Plugin-Based Options
--------------------

In addition to the storage APIs listed above, the [File
API](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/master/README.md)
allows you to cache data on the local file system. Other [Cordova
plugins](http://plugins.cordova.io/) provide similar storage options.
