Third-party Cordova Plugins are Cordova plugins which provide the
possibility of adding native code into JavaScript code. Monaca provides
several third-party plugins by default, but you can also import other
third-party plugins or your own plugin to Monaca project.

We also provide a way to extend your program using native code. Please
refer to [Custom Cordova Plugin](/en/products_guide/monaca_ide/dependencies/custom_cordova_plugin) on how to create and use a native
plugin.

The followings are pre-configured third-party Cordova plugins provided
by Monaca:

- [BarcodeScanner Plugin](barcode_scanner)
- [Cordova Custom Config Plugin](custom_config)
- [DatePicker Plugin](datepicker)
- [Share Plugin (Android)](share)
