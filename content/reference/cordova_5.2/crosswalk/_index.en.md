This plugin makes your Cordova application uses the [Crosswalk WebView](https://crosswalk-project.org/) instead of the System WebView.

## What is Crosswalk?

There are many versions of Android from many manufacturers, this makes
it very difficult to develop a Cordova app that works consistently
across all versions of Android. WebView version affects display and some
operations on a device. Until Android 4.4, WebView upgrade can only be
done through OS upgrade. When most of these devices cannot be upgraded,
they are stuck using outdated Android WebViews. Crosswalk can solve this
problem.

Crosswalk is a web runtime based on Google Chromium and has better HTML5
feature support compared to the default WebView available in Android. By
upgrading the version of Crosswalk, Chromium version will also be
upgraded. This insures that your app works consistently, regardless of
the device manufacturer or Android version found in your customer's
Android 4.0+ device.

default Crosswalk plugin set by Monaca.

Pros and Cons of Crosswalk Plugin
---------------------------------

Advantages | Disadvantages
-----------|--------------------
<ul><li>WebView installed on each device has the same version. The problem due to different operations of API has been solved.</li><li>The latest version of WebView (Android 4 is not supported) is being used, performance improvement is expected.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Building a Crosswalk app results in `2 APK` files: one `arm` and one for `x86` CPU architecture. Both of them need to be uploaded to GooglePlay.</li><li>When there is bugs in Crosswalk (Chromium), all devices will be having the same bugs.</li><li>App size can be `+20MB` bigger.</li><li>When there is a serious bug occurs in Crosswalk, the app might stop working until it is solved.</li><li>If there is vulnerability occurrs in Crosswalk(Chromium), there will be a warning in Google Play that the app may be publicly unavailable.</li><li>For Android 5.0 or higher, WebView is made as another app, so it will always needed to be updated. Therefore, Crosswalkâ€™s WebView version maybe out of dated.</li></ul>
