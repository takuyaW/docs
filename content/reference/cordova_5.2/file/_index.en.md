This document is based on the original Cordova docs available at {{<link title="Cordova Docs" href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file">}}.
{{</note>}}

This plugin implements a File API allowing read/write access to files
residing on the device.

This plugin is based on several specs, including: The HTML5 File API
<http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/>

The (now-defunct) Directories and System extensions Latest:
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-file-system-api-20120417/> Although most
of the plugin code was written when an earlier spec was current:
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-file-system-api-20110419/>

It also implements the FileWriter spec:
<http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/file-writer.html>

For usage, please refer to HTML5 Rocks' excellent [FileSystem
article.](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/)

For an overview of other storage options, refer to Cordova's [storage
guide](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/cordova_storage_storage.md.html).

This plugin defines global `cordova.file` object.

Although in the global scope, it is not available until after the
`deviceready` event.

    document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
    function onDeviceReady() {
        console.log(cordova.file);
    }

API Reference
-------------

### Where to Store Files

As of v1.2.0, URLs to important file-system directories are provided.
Each URL is in the form \*<file:///path/to/spot/*>, and can be converted
to a `DirectoryEntry` using `window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL()`.

-   `cordova.file.applicationDirectory` - Read-only directory where the
    application is installed. (*iOS*, *Android*, *BlackBerry 10*, *OSX*,
    *windows*)
-   `cordova.file.applicationStorageDirectory` - Root directory of the
    application's sandbox; on iOS & windows this location is read-only
    (but specific subdirectories \[like `/Documents` on iOS or
    `/localState` on windows\] are read-write). All data contained
    within is private to the app. (*iOS*, *Android*, *BlackBerry 10*,
    *OSX*)
-   `cordova.file.dataDirectory` - Persistent and private data storage
    within the application's sandbox using internal memory (on Android,
    if you need to use external memory, use `.externalDataDirectory`).
    On iOS, this directory is not synced with iCloud (use
    `.syncedDataDirectory`). (*iOS*, *Android*, *BlackBerry 10*,
    *windows*)
-   `cordova.file.cacheDirectory` - Directory for cached data files or
    any files that your app can re-create easily. The OS may delete
    these files when the device runs low on storage, nevertheless, apps
    should not rely on the OS to delete files in here. (*iOS*,
    *Android*, *BlackBerry 10*, *OSX*, *windows*)
-   `cordova.file.externalApplicationStorageDirectory` - Application
    space on external storage. (*Android*)
-   `cordova.file.externalDataDirectory` - Where to put app-specific
    data files on external storage. (*Android*)
-   `cordova.file.externalCacheDirectory` - Application cache on
    external storage. (*Android*)
-   `cordova.file.externalRootDirectory` - External storage (SD card)
    root. (*Android*, *BlackBerry 10*)
-   `cordova.file.tempDirectory` - Temp directory that the OS can clear
    at will. Do not rely on the OS to clear this directory; your app
    should always remove files as applicable. (*iOS*, *OSX*, *windows*)
-   `cordova.file.syncedDataDirectory` - Holds app-specific files that
    should be synced (e.g. to iCloud). (*iOS*, *windows*)
-   `cordova.file.documentsDirectory` - Files private to the app, but
    that are meaningful to other application (e.g. Office files). Note
    that for *OSX* this is the user's `~/Documents` directory. (*iOS*,
    *OSX*)
-   `cordova.file.sharedDirectory` - Files globally available to all
    applications (*BlackBerry 10*)

### Android Quirks

#### Android Persistent storage location

There are multiple valid locations to store persistent files on an
Android device. See [this
page](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html)
for an extensive discussion of the various possibilities.

Previous versions of the plugin would choose the location of the
temporary and persistent files on startup, based on whether the device
claimed that the SD Card (or equivalent storage partition) was mounted.
If the SD Card was mounted, or if a large internal storage partition was
available (such as on Nexus devices,) then the persistent files would be
stored in the root of that space. This meant that all Cordova apps could
see all of the files available on the card.

If the SD card was not available, then previous versions would store
data under `/data/data/<packageId>`, which isolates apps from each
other, but may still cause data to be shared between users.

It is now possible to choose whether to store files in the internal file
storage location, or using the previous logic, with a preference in your
application's `config.xml` file. To do this, add one of these two lines
to `config.xml`:

    <preference name="AndroidPersistentFileLocation" value="Internal" />

    <preference name="AndroidPersistentFileLocation" value="Compatibility" />

Without this line, the File plugin will use `Internal` as the default.
If a preference tag is present, and is not one of these values, the
application will not start.

If your application has previously been shipped to users, using an older
(pre- 3.0.0) version of this plugin, and has stored files in the
persistent filesystem, then you should set the preference to
`Compatibility` if your config.xml does not specify a location for the
persistent filesystem. Switching the location to "Internal" would mean
that existing users who upgrade their application may be unable to
access their previously-stored files, depending on their device.

If your application is new, or has never previously stored files in the
persistent filesystem, then the `Internal` setting is generally
recommended.

#### Slow recursive operations for /android\_asset

Listing asset directories is really slow on Android. You can speed it up
though, by adding `src/android/build-extras.gradle` to the root of your
android project (also requires cordova-android 4.0.0 or greater).

### iOS Quirks

-   `cordova.file.applicationStorageDirectory` is read-only; attempting
    to store files within the root directory will fail. Use one of the
    other `cordova.file.*` properties defined for iOS (only
    `applicationDirectory` and `applicationStorageDirectory` are
    read-only).
-   `FileReader.readAsText(blob, encoding)`
-   The `encoding` parameter is not supported, and UTF-8 encoding is
    always in effect.

#### iOS Persistent storage location

There are two valid locations to store persistent files on an iOS
device: the Documents directory and the Library directory. Previous
versions of the plugin only ever stored persistent files in the
Documents directory. This had the side-effect of making all of an
application's files visible in iTunes, which was often unintended,
especially for applications which handle lots of small files, rather
than producing complete documents for export, which is the intended
purpose of the directory.

It is now possible to choose whether to store files in the documents or
library directory, with a preference in your application's `config.xml`
file. To do this, add one of these two lines to `config.xml`:

    <preference name="iosPersistentFileLocation" value="Library" />

    <preference name="iosPersistentFileLocation" value="Compatibility" />

Without this line, the File plugin will use `Compatibility` as the
default. If a preference tag is present, and is not one of these values,
the application will not start.

If your application has previously been shipped to users, using an older
(pre- 1.0) version of this plugin, and has stored files in the
persistent filesystem, then you should set the preference to
`Compatibility`. Switching the location to `Library` would mean that
existing users who upgrade their application would be unable to access
their previously-stored files.

If your application is new, or has never previously stored files in the
persistent filesystem, then the `Library` setting is generally
recommended.

### Firefox OS Quirks

The File System API is not natively supported by Firefox OS and is
implemented as a shim on top of indexedDB.

-   Does not fail when removing non-empty directories
-   Does not support metadata for directories
-   Methods `copyTo` and `moveTo` do not support directories

The following data paths are supported:

\* `applicationDirectory` - Uses `xhr` to get local files that are
packaged with the app.

\* `dataDirectory` - For persistent app-specific data files.

\* `cacheDirectory` - Cached files that should survive app restarts
(Apps should not rely on the OS to delete files in here).

### Browser Quirks

#### Common quirks and remarks

-   Each browser uses its own sandboxed filesystem. IE and Firefox use
    IndexedDB as a base. All browsers use forward slash as directory
    separator in a path.
-   Directory entries have to be created successively. For example, the
    call
    `fs.root.getDirectory('dir1/dir2', {create:true}, successCallback, errorCallback)`
    will fail if dir1 did not exist.
-   The plugin requests user permission to use persistent storage at the
    application first start.
-   Plugin supports `cdvfile://localhost` (local resources) only. I.e.
    external resources are not supported via `cdvfile`.
-   The plugin does not follow ["File System API 8.3 Naming
    restrictions"](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-file-system-api-20110419/#naming-restrictions).
-   Blob and File' `close` function is not supported.
-   `FileSaver` and `BlobBuilder` are not supported by this plugin and
    don't have stubs.
-   The plugin does not support `requestAllFileSystems`. This function
    is also missing in the specifications.
-   Entries in directory will not be removed if you use `create: true`
    flag for existing directory.
-   Files created via constructor are not supported. You should use
    entry.file method instead.
-   Each browser uses its own form for blob URL references.
-   `readAsDataURL` function is supported, but the mediatype in Chrome
    depends on entry name extension, mediatype in IE is always empty
    (which is the same as `text-plain` according the specification), the
    mediatype in Firefox is always `application/octet-stream`. For
    example, if the content is `abcdefg` then Firefox returns
    `data:application/octet-stream;base64,YWJjZGVmZw==`, IE returns
    `data:;base64,YWJjZGVmZw==`, Chrome returns
    `data:<mediatype depending on extension of entry name>;base64,YWJjZGVmZw==`.
-   `toInternalURL` returns the path in the form
    `file:///persistent/path/to/entry` (Firefox, IE). Chrome returns the
    path in the form `cdvfile://localhost/persistent/file`.

#### Chrome quirks

Chrome filesystem is not immediately ready after device ready event. As
a workaround you can subscribe to `filePluginIsReady` event.

> Example:
>
> ``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
> window.addEventListener('filePluginIsReady', function(){ console.log('File plugin is ready');}, false);
> ```

You can use `window.isFilePluginReadyRaised` function to check whether
event was already raised.

-   window.requestFileSystem TEMPORARY and PERSISTENT filesystem quotas
    are not limited in Chrome.
-   To increase persistent storage in Chrome you need to call
    `window.initPersistentFileSystem` method. Persistent storage quota
    is 5 MB by default.
-   Chrome requires `--allow-file-access-from-files` run argument to
    support API via `file:///` protocol.
-   `File` object will be not changed if you use flag `{create:true}`
    when getting an existing `Entry`.
-   events `cancelable` property is set to true in Chrome. This is
    contrary to the
    [specification](http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/file-writer.html).
-   `toURL` function in Chrome returns `filesystem:`-prefixed path
    depending on application host. For example,
    `filesystem:file:///persistent/somefile.txt`,
    `filesystem:http://localhost:8080/persistent/somefile.txt`.
-   `toURL` function result does not contain trailing slash in case of
    directory entry. Chrome resolves directories with slash-trailed urls
    correctly though.
-   `resolveLocalFileSystemURL` method requires the inbound `url` to
    have `filesystem` prefix. For example, `url` parameter for
    `resolveLocalFileSystemURL` should be in the form
    `filesystem:file:///persistent/somefile.txt` as opposed to the form
    `file:///persistent/somefile.txt` in Android.
-   Deprecated `toNativeURL` function is not supported and does not have
    a stub.
-   `setMetadata` function is not stated in the specifications and not
    supported.
-   INVALID\_MODIFICATION\_ERR (code: 9) is thrown instead of
    SYNTAX\_ERR(code: 8) on requesting of a non-existent filesystem.
-   INVALID\_MODIFICATION\_ERR (code: 9) is thrown instead of
    PATH\_EXISTS\_ERR(code: 12) on trying to exclusively create a file
    or directory, which already exists.
-   INVALID\_MODIFICATION\_ERR (code: 9) is thrown instead of
    NO\_MODIFICATION\_ALLOWED\_ERR(code: 6) on trying to call
    removeRecursively on the root file system.
-   INVALID\_MODIFICATION\_ERR (code: 9) is thrown instead of
    NOT\_FOUND\_ERR(code: 1) on trying to moveTo directory that does not
    exist.

#### IndexedDB-based impl quirks (Firefox and IE)

-   `.` and `..` are not supported.
-   IE does not support `file:///`-mode; only hosted mode is supported
    ([http://localhost:xxxx](http://localhost:xxxx)).
-   Firefox filesystem size is not limited but each 50MB extension will
    request a user permission. IE10 allows up to 10mb of combined
    AppCache and IndexedDB used in implementation of filesystem without
    prompting, once you hit that level you will be asked if you want to
    allow it to be increased up to a max of 250mb per site. So `size`
    parameter for `requestFileSystem` function does not affect
    filesystem in Firefox and IE.
-   `readAsBinaryString` function is not stated in the Specs and not
    supported in IE and does not have a stub.
-   `file.type` is always null.
-   You should not create entry using DirectoryEntry instance callback
    result which was deleted. Otherwise, you will get a 'hanging entry'.
-   Before you can read a file, which was just written you need to get a
    new instance of this file.
-   `setMetadata` function, which is not stated in the Specs supports
    `modificationTime` field change only.
-   `copyTo` and `moveTo` functions do not support directories.
    Directories metadata is not supported.
-   Both Entry.remove and directoryEntry.removeRecursively don't fail
    when removing non-empty directories - directories being removed are
    cleaned along with contents instead.
-   `abort` and `truncate` functions are not supported.
-   progress events are not fired. For example, this handler will be not
    executed:

Example:

> ``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
> writer.onprogress = function() { /*commands*/ };
> ```

### Upgrading Notes

In v1.0.0 of this plugin, the `FileEntry` and `DirectoryEntry`
structures have changed, to be more in line with the published
specification.

Previous (pre-1.0.0) versions of the plugin stored the
device-absolute-file-location in the `fullPath` property of `Entry`
objects. These paths would typically look like

    /var/mobile/Applications/<application UUID>/Documents/path/to/file  (iOS)
    /storage/emulated/0/path/to/file                                    (Android)

These paths were also returned by the `toURL()` method of the `Entry`
objects.

With v1.0.0, the `fullPath` attribute is the path to the file, *relative
to the root of the HTML filesystem*. So, the above paths would now both
be represented by a `FileEntry` object with a `fullPath` of

    /path/to/file

If your application works with device-absolute-paths, and you previously
retrieved those paths through the `fullPath` property of `Entry`
objects, then you should update your code to use `entry.toURL()`
instead.

For backwards compatibility, the `resolveLocalFileSystemURL()` method
will accept a device-absolute-path, and will return an `Entry` object
corresponding to it, as long as that file exists within either the
`TEMPORARY` or `PERSISTENT` filesystems.

This has particularly been an issue with the File-Transfer plugin, which
previously used device-absolute-paths (and can still accept them). It
has been updated to work correctly with FileSystem URLs, so replacing
`entry.fullPath` with `entry.toURL()` should resolve any issues getting
that plugin to work with files on the device.

In v1.1.0 the return value of `toURL()` was changed (see
[CB-6394](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-6394)) to return an
absolute '<file://>' URL. wherever possible. To ensure a 'cdvfile:'-URL
you can use `toInternalURL()` now. This method will now return
filesystem URLs of the form

    cdvfile://localhost/persistent/path/to/file

which can be used to identify the file uniquely.

### cdvfile protocol

**Purpose**

`cdvfile://localhost/persistent|temporary|another-fs-root*/path/to/file`
can be used for platform-independent file paths. cdvfile paths are
supported by core plugins - for example you can download an mp3 file to
cdvfile-path via `cordova-plugin-file-transfer` and play it via
`cordova-plugin-media`.

**Note**: See [Where to Store Files](#where-to-store-files), [File
System Layouts](#file-system-layouts) and [Configuring the
Plugin](#configuring-the-plugin-optional) for more details about
available fs roots.

To use `cdvfile` as a tag' `src` you can convert it to native path via
`toURL()` method of the resolved fileEntry, which you can get via
`resolveLocalFileSystemURL` - see examples below.

You can also use `cdvfile://` paths directly in the DOM, for example:

``` {.sourceCode .html}
<img src="cdvfile://localhost/persistent/img/logo.png" />
```

**Note**: This method requires following Content Security rules updates:

-   Add `cdvfile:` scheme to `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag of the
    index page, e.g.:

> -   `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self' data: gap:`**cdvfile:**`https://ssl.gstatic.com 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; media-src *">`

-   Add `<access origin="cdvfile://*" />` to `config.xml`.

**Converting cdvfile:// to native path**

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
resolveLocalFileSystemURL('cdvfile://localhost/temporary/path/to/file.mp4', function(entry) {
    var nativePath = entry.toURL();
    console.log('Native URI: ' + nativePath);
    document.getElementById('video').src = nativePath;
```

**Converting native path to cdvfile://**

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
resolveLocalFileSystemURL(nativePath, function(entry) {
    console.log('cdvfile URI: ' + entry.toInternalURL());
```

**Using cdvfile in core plugins**

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
fileTransfer.download(uri, 'cdvfile://localhost/temporary/path/to/file.mp3', function (entry) { ...
```

``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var my_media = new Media('cdvfile://localhost/temporary/path/to/file.mp3', ...); my_media.play();
```

#### cdvfile quirks

-   Using `cdvfile://` paths in the DOM is not supported on Windows
    platform (a path can be converted to native instead).

### List of Error Codes and Meanings

When an error is thrown, one of the following codes will be used.

Code | Constant
-----|------------------
`1` | `NOT_FOUND_ERR`
`2` | `SECURITY_ERR`
`3` | `ABORT_ERR`
`4` | `NOT_READABLE_ERR`
`5` | `ENCODING_ERR`
`6` | `NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR`
`7` | `INVALID_STATE_ERR`
`8` | `SYNTAX_ERR`
`9` | `INVALID_MODIFICATION_ERR`
`10` | `QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR`
`11` | `TYPE_MISMATCH_ERR`
`12` | `PATH_EXISTS_ERR`

### Configuring the Plugin (Optional)

The set of available filesystems can be configured per-platform. Both
iOS and Android recognize a tag in `config.xml` which names the
filesystems to be installed. By default, all file-system roots are
enabled.

    <preference name="iosExtraFilesystems" value="library,library-nosync,documents,documents-nosync,cache,bundle,root" />
    <preference name="AndroidExtraFilesystems" value="files,files-external,documents,sdcard,cache,cache-external,root" />

#### Android

-   `files`: The application's internal file storage directory
-   `files-external`: The application's external file storage directory
-   `sdcard`: The global external file storage directory (this is the
    root of the SD card, if one is installed). You must have the
    `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission to use this.
-   `cache`: The application's internal cache directory
-   `cache-external`: The application's external cache directory
-   `root`: The entire device filesystem

Android also supports a special filesystem named "documents", which
represents a "/Documents/" subdirectory within the "files" filesystem.

#### iOS

-   `library`: The application's Library directory
-   `documents`: The application's Documents directory
-   `cache`: The application's Cache directory
-   `bundle`: The application's bundle; the location of the app itself
    on disk (read-only)
-   `root`: The entire device filesystem

By default, the library and documents directories can be synced to
iCloud. You can also request two additional filesystems,
`library-nosync` and `documents-nosync`, which represent a special
non-synced directory within the `/Library` or `/Documents` filesystem.
