This plugin provides an implementation of an old version of the [Network
Information API](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-netinfo-api-20110607/). It
provides information about the device's cellular and wifi connection,
and whether the device has an internet connection.

Plugin ID
-------------

    org.apache.cordova.network-information

Enable Plugin in Monaca
-----------------------

In order to use this plugin, please [enable](/en/products_guide/monaca_ide/dependencies/cordova_plugin/#add-plugins)
`org.apache.cordova.network-information` plugin in Monaca Cloud IDE.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

-   Amazon Fire OS
-   Android
-   iOS

Connection
==========

> The `connection` object, exposed via `navigator.connection`, provides
> information about the device's cellular and wifi connection.

Properties
----------

-   connection.type

Constants
---------

-   Connection.UNKNOWN
-   Connection.ETHERNET
-   Connection.WIFI
-   Connection.CELL\_2G
-   Connection.CELL\_3G
-   Connection.CELL\_4G
-   Connection.CELL
-   Connection.NONE

connection.type
---------------

This property offers a fast way to determine the device's network
connection state, and type of connection.

### Quick Example

    function checkConnection() {
        var networkState = navigator.connection.type;

        var states = {};
        states[Connection.UNKNOWN]  = 'Unknown connection';
        states[Connection.ETHERNET] = 'Ethernet connection';
        states[Connection.WIFI]     = 'WiFi connection';
        states[Connection.CELL_2G]  = 'Cell 2G connection';
        states[Connection.CELL_3G]  = 'Cell 3G connection';
        states[Connection.CELL_4G]  = 'Cell 4G connection';
        states[Connection.CELL]     = 'Cell generic connection';
        states[Connection.NONE]     = 'No network connection';

        alert('Connection type: ' + states[networkState]);
    }

    checkConnection();

### API Change

Until Cordova 2.3.0, the `Connection` object was accessed via
`navigator.network.connection`, after which it was changed to
`navigator.connection` to match the W3C specification. It's still
available at its original location, but is deprecated and will
eventually be removed.

### iOS Quirks

-   iOS can't detect the type of cellular network connection.
    -   `navigator.connection.type` is set to `Connection.CELL` for all
        cellular data.

Network-related Events
======================

offline
-------

The event fires when an application goes offline, and the device is not
connected to the Internet.

    document.addEventListener("offline", yourCallbackFunction, false);

### Details

The `offline` event fires when a previously connected device loses a
network connection so that an application can no longer access the
Internet. It relies on the same information as the Connection API, and
fires when the value of `connection.type` becomes `NONE`.

Applications typically should use `document.addEventListener` to attach
an event listener once the `deviceready` event fires.

### Quick Example

    document.addEventListener("offline", onOffline, false);

    function onOffline() {
        // Handle the offline event
    }

### iOS Quirks

During initial startup, the first offline event (if applicable) takes at
least a second to fire.

online
------

This event fires when an application goes online, and the device becomes
connected to the Internet.

    document.addEventListener("online", yourCallbackFunction, false);

### Details

The `online` event fires when a previously unconnected device receives a
network connection to allow an application access to the Internet. It
relies on the same information as the Connection API, and fires when the
`connection.type` changes from `NONE` to any other value.

Applications typically should use `document.addEventListener` to attach
an event listener once the `deviceready` event fires.

### Quick Example

    document.addEventListener("online", onOnline, false);

    function onOnline() {
        // Handle the online event
    }

### iOS Quirks

During initial startup, the first `online` event (if applicable) takes
at least a second to fire, prior to which `connection.type` is
`UNKNOWN`.
