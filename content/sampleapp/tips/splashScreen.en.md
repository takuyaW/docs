Splash screen is displayed while waiting for the `index.html` page to
load. You can manually hide the splash screen by using JavaScript code
`navigator.splashscreen.hide()` or by setting in Monaca Cloud IDE.

Here are how to hide the splash screen manually in Monaca Cloud IDE:

## Settings for Android

1.  From Monaca Cloud IDE menu, go to {{<menu menu1="Config" menu2="Android App Settings">}}.
2.  Scroll to `Splash Files`. In order to hide (disable) the splash screen, you can set the display time to `0`.
3.  Then, save your settings.
