Part 1: Starting a Project
==========================

In this page, we describe a step-by-step instruction of how to:

-   start a new local project from a template provided by Monaca. You
    can also import projects you have in Monaca Cloud IDE or other
    existing Cordova projects into Monaca Localkit as well. Please refer
    to localkit\_import.
-   preview your project right from the Monaca Localkit without the use
    of real devices.
-   edit the project files.

3.  If the project is created successfully, the new project will be
    shown in the project list.

Step 3: Previewing the Project
------------------------------

In Monaca Localkit, you can run the project using Live Preview function
without real devices. However, some functionalitlies of some
applications might not be properly previewed. For more information,
please refer to
usage and limitation of Live Preview &lt;preview\_tab&gt;.

In order to preview a project, please do as follows:

1.  From Monaca Localkit dashboard, click on a project we just created.
2.  Click on Preview button.

Step 4: Editing the Project Files

    this, you can either click Open button or right-click on the Memo
    Application project, then click Open in (see screenshot below).

2.  Then, a new window showing your project files location will be
    displayed. The project files that you will be editing directly are
    in `www` folder. `components` folder consists of project's
    dependencies such as jQuery Mobile. Please ignore this folder. Use
    any code editors you prefer to edit the rest of the project files
    such as JavaScript, CSS and HTML files.

3.  Now, let's edit the `index.html` file. Try changing some lines in
    this page and save them.
4.  Use Preview function to see the change. If your Preview is already
    opened, the change will be updated immediately after you save the
    changes.
