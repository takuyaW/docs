What happens to my projects when I downgrade to Basic plan?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Your projects stay the same and you can still work on them as usual. If
your total projects are more than 3, you cannot create a new project
because a Basic plan user can only have up to 3 active projects.
Moreover, you may run into storage and inactive limitation issues. For
more information, please refer to [Pricing
page](https://monaca.io/pricing-detail.html).

What happens to my shared projects when I downgrade to Basic plan?
------------------------------------------------------------------

-   If you are a member of a shared project and have a Developer role,
    you will become a Tester.
-   If you are the owner of a shared project, you can still work on it
    normally but you cannot manage (add/remove) project member(s)
    anymore.

How can I get a student discount?
---------------------------------

institution, you will receive a discount on any Monaca subscription
plan. In order to receive or inquire about this discount, please contact
