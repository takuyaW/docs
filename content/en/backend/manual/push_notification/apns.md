iOS App Push Notification Settings
==================================

APNs (Apple Push Notification Service) is a push notification mechanism
created by Apple to use with iOS apps. In this page, we will show what
you need to do in order to enable push notifications service for iOS
applications with Monaca.

Step 2: Create Push Certificates in iOS Dev Center
--------------------------------------------------

There are two types of Push certificates which can be issued in iOS Dev
Center:

-   Development SSL Certificate: required for Debug build
-   Production SSL Certificate: required for either Ad Hoc or Release
    build.

To create Push certificates, please proceed as follows:

1.  From [Apple Developer page](https://developer.apple.com/), go to
    Member Center.
2.  Sign in using Apple ID and password you used to enroll in the iOS
    Developer Program. If you havenâ€™t enrolled in this program yet,
    please subscribe at
    [here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/).
3.  Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles. Then, the following page
    will appear:

    Notifications service in iOS Dev Center. Please refer to
