There is a growing need for mobile apps to have user management
functions which allow users to register and keep their data in a
database. Monaca Backend provides these functionality in advance as a
cloud-based service that can manage users without a need for server-side
development on the client part.

-   Monaca Backend sample app is described in backend\_database\_memo.
-   Monaca Backend API is listed in backend\_api\_index.
