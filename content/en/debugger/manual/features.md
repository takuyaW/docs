you can:

-   favorite current project: moves it to the top of the project list.
-   lunch app: runs current project in the debugger.

<div class="admonition note">

In order to use network install, you need to create a debug build of the
project from Monaca Cloud IDE first. Please refer to
debug build for iOS &lt;types\_of\_build\_ios&gt; or
debug build for Android &lt;types\_of\_build\_android&gt;.

</div>

<div class="admonition note">

For iOS debugger, network install is only available for the
custom built debugger &lt;custom\_debugger\_ios&gt;. The App store
version doesn't have this function.
