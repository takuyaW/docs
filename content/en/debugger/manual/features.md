you can:

-   favorite current project: moves it to the top of the project list.
-   lunch app: runs current project in the debugger.
-   use network install: installs a built app of the current project
    directly from Monaca debugger.

> **note**
>
> In order to use network install, you need to create a debug build of
> the project from Monaca Cloud IDE first. Please refer to
> debug build for iOS \<types\_of\_build\_ios\> or
> debug build for Android \<types\_of\_build\_android\>.

> **note**
>
> For iOS debugger, network install is only available for the
> custom built debugger \<custom\_debugger\_ios\>. The App store version
> doesn't have this function.
