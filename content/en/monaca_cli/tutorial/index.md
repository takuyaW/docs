# Monaca CLI Tutorial

Monaca CLI is one of the local development environments which can be
used to develop Monaca apps locally. Monaca CLI provides command line
interface for using Monaca Cloud from your local PC. You can create new
local projects, import or clone existing projects from Monaca Cloud to
your local PC and start developing Monaca apps with any editors you
prefer. Monaca CLI allows you to debug your app with inspector
integration and remote build your projects without any setups locally.
