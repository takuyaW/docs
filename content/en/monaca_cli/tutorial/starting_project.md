Step 2: Creating a New Project
------------------------------

1.  Create a new project by using the command below:

> ``` {.sourceCode .bash}
> $ monaca create PROJECT_DIRECTORY
> ```

2.  Then, you will be asked to choose either `Sample Apps` or
    `Templates` to create a new Monaca project. In this tutorial, let's
    choose the `Sample Apps` option. Then, select `jQuery TODO App`.

3.  After creating the project, the project's folder will be created on
    your PC. You can then use any local editors to develop your Monaca
    projects.

You can also use Monaca CLI to import&lt;monaca\_import&gt; or
clone&lt;monaca\_clone&gt; your existing projects from Monaca Cloud.
