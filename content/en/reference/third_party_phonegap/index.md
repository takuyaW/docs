Third-party Cordova Plugins
===========================

Third-party Cordova Plugins are Cordova plugins which provide the
possibility of adding native code into JavaScript code. Monaca provides
several third-party plugins by default, but you can also import other
third-party plugins or your own plugin to Monaca project.

We also provide a way to extend your program using native code. Please
refer to custom\_cordova\_plugin on how to create and use a native
plugin.

The followings are pre-configured third-party Cordova plugins provided
by Monaca:
